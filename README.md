# Ingress NGINX test setup

This repository contains a local setup for testing [PR #11709](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/11709) of the Ingress NGINX Controller project.

## Requirements

The following tools are required for running the scripts:

- [Helm](https://helm.sh)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io)

## Getting started

Create a new Kind cluster:

```bash
./001_setup_kind.sh
```

Deploy the latest version of the ingress-nginx controller:

```bash
./002_deploy_ingress.sh
```

Deploy the podinfo application:

```bash
./003_deploy_podinfo.sh
```

## Test 1 âœ…

The podinfo-app uses a custom response header `X-TEST` and the initial value is `v01`. This can be verified with the following curl command:

```bash
curl -v -H "Host: podinfo.local" localhost:8001
* Host localhost:8001 was resolved.
* IPv6: ::1
* IPv4: 127.0.0.1
*   Trying [::1]:8001...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8001
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: podinfo.local
> User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
> Accept: */*
> 
* Request completely sent off
